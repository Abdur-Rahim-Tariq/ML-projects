# 📞 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction App

A machine learning-powered **Streamlit web application** that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to **churn (leave the service)** based on their demographic, account, and service-related data.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project helps telecom companies identify customers at risk of leaving their services.  
Using a trained **Logistic Regression model**, the app analyzes customer features like contract type, payment method, tenure, and monthly charges to predict churn probability.  

It includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Model Training**, and an **interactive web interface** for real-time predictions.

## 🧩 Workflow

1️⃣ Data Collection → Load and explore customer dataset  
2️⃣ EDA → Identify churn patterns, correlations, and customer segments  
3️⃣ Preprocessing → Encode, scale, and clean data  
4️⃣ Model Training → Logistic Regression model trained on labeled data  
5️⃣ Evaluation → Compute performance metrics (F1, ROC-AUC, etc.)  
6️⃣ Deployment → Build interactive Streamlit app for live predictions
